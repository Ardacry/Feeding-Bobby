Feeding Bobby is a progressive single-player game for computers in which the user will start off as a little fish and throughout the span of the game, the main goal of the player will be to get bigger by eating smaller fish and (def)eating the final boss. By getting bigger, the character will evolve into bigger species. During the game, the user will try to survive by evading bigger fish. The surrounding environment will also offer some special power-ups and threats to the player such as freeze time, speed boost, vitality, hostile fishing rods which will immediately kill the character. As the game progresses, it gets harder as well by sending more threats to the player’s way. The player will build up scores by evolving and eating. The final score will be converted and added to the user’s in-game currency that can be used to buy various skins and backgrounds.
